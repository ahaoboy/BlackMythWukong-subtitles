1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Here, we can venture forth with you no further.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,620
This task is yours alone.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,400
Sun Wukong left behind a broken shell, stripped of all his six senses.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,340
Though ages have passed, it maintains a connection attuned to the echoes of his former self.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,980
If you truly are the one destined, you must cast aside his soulless shell and merge the

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,440
six into one.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,580
Then, you shall be the one to begin the journey anew.

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,880
No!

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
Not on his own!

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,800
He's just a kid who knows nothing!

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,860
I'll go with him!

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,880
This place is shaped by Wukong's lingering obsession.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,320
It allows only his own self.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,520
It allows only his relic-bearer to face the final ordeal.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,720
We can escort him no more.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
See it for yourself.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,760
Hear me, Sun!

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,960
You can always run!

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,780
You don't have to bear Wukong's name!

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,940
...
