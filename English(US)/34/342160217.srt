1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
No wind wrought such destruction here.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,180
The Samadhi wind brought only malice here.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,760
Vajiras and Arhats before the yellow wind shivered.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,640
Mounts of Bodhisattvas, a lion's siren and an elephant white, in fear quivered.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,080
A wicked Yaoguai of fierce might followed a discerning master.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
It was his blessing, but also became his curse.
