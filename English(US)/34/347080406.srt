1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,760
Admiral why so stubborn keep at it you could melt into blood and pus

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,740
Darling come on. It's perfectly cool in here

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,900
Join me inside for some yin yang practice with you

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,520
such humor

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,460
Admiral let go of your stubbornness and I could request master to set you free

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,480
Then I'd be open to joining you

9
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,420
Even you celestial courtier bend to his will

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,040
Yet my ears tell me that the destined one has stopped the money will

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,880
Pity reckon it won't be your master who unlocks these metals eventually

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,020
These gold symbols are made by our Grand Master

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,320
And you think a puny monkey can go beyond that?

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Yeah

15
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,460
You

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
You

17
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
You

18
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
You

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
You

20
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
You

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,200
You've roused turtle general. How could you know he's here below?

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,820
Turtle snake who cares I caught a whiff of monkey stench familiar enough for me to sound by welcome

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Master values

24
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Master values

25
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,900
Master values

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,000
Master values

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,440
Master values

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Master values

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Master values your talent he kept you alive beneath the pagoda for your own good

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Master values your talents he kept you alive beneath the pagoda for your own good

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,760
How ungrateful evidently you just don't deserve the ecstasy of the new west

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,820
Stay watching for the next episode of winter
