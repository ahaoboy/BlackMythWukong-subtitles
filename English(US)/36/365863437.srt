00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Oi, the lad from the village.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,920
Tis calmer, I tell ye.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,020
His old man murdered neighbours, all to cure the sickly boy.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,320
Surely them villagers would come at the lad for revenge.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,220
But they've all gone now.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,280
Wandering ghosts they've all become.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Why you be staring at me, eh?

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,140
Why would I help him?

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,780
I was scared too.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,680
Aren't you expecting too much from an old man?
