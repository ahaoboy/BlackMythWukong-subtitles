Say, what's to come of destiny if he steps out of that mural?

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,080
I make a living by reading what was written. The signs alone tell what's to come.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,460
What's to come is what's not yet written. No one can read what's not written.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,660
Destiny is written in what's done. What's done shapes what's to come, not escape.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,700
Hm. It's all written for me, if only I uncover all that occurred.

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,180
So, there really is something even you cannot read.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,980
That's good. Very good.

00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,660
Thank you for watching!
