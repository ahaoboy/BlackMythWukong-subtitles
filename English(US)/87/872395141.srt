1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
You freed me from the threat of him.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,120
Now I can set foot on the mountain without worrying.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,880
Thank you, young master.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,840
I've kept an eye on him.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
He's quite peculiar.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,700
He roamed the woods, yet never scaled the mountaintop.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,520
As if evading a presence.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,020
I heard whispers of his blood feud with whatever dwells there.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,620
Death is a blessing when it ends the agony of separation.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,020
A good end for him at last.
