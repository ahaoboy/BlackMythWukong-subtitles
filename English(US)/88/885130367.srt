1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Help! Help me, young master!

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,320
It's you, kind monkey! Help me! Help me, please!

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,320
Things went south in the mountain and I barely escaped.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,380
But on my way down, Gwai's captured me.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been kept here for three days.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,420
But now my luck has returned.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,900
My savior appeared here right in front of me.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,980
Should you extend your mercy to save my family?

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,840
I'll repay your kindness at any cost.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,460
Master got it right.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,800
The last surely knows how to ask for help.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,320
It's them.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,880
My captors are back. Please don't leave me.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,220
Easy catch.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,600
And what now?

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,600
Burn them all to cinders!

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,460
Ha ha ha! Burn them! Burn them!

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,400
Keep em safe.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,900
It's too late now.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,400
Okay, it's over.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,760
They stood up to command the forces on the Englishная warrior центр.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Must have been the muốnir of those components.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:27,740
No, they must be being pushed onto byinäainaā in return.

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,240
A man must five times have to keep them in place.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,360
And that's really what happened!

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,460
Oh, yes.
