1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Ever heard tell of the Destined One, my friend?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,600
They say he marches and fights on a quest to bring back the Great Sage!

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,900
The Great Sage and my King once swore a brotherhood.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,820
After the Sage fell, the King dismissed every one of us.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,660
He became someone, not himself.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,500
If the Destined One is really the one who can bring back the Sage,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,220
he can count on my humble support.
