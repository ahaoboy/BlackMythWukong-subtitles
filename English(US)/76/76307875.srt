1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Keep this cicada safe with you. It'll come in handy.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,780
Enough about your brother. If you care for him so much, why not go back to him and give me some peace?

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,300
If you won't act, Mother, then I implore you to lend me your plantain fan to save Father.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,760
Save him? Or this mountain from its doom? Both are beyond this fan.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,680
Mother, please. I am begging you. Father's life hangs on a thread. A thread which Brother could cut short any moment.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,300
Since when did you start caring for that old bull?

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
Do not think you can hide your secret wish from me.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,800
You wish you could rule this mountain with your brother once we are finished.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,740
If you won't act, Mother, then I implore you to lend me your plantain fan to save Father.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,120
If you want to save Father, then I will.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:08,620
You are a cunning fox. You just want to trade my fan for a smile on your brother's face.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,120
I owe my life to Father. And to your kindness for taking me in.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Brother was good to me, but I would never betray my parents for him.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Say no more of the fact that you love Father.

15
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,120
I am a good man. We raised the boy. Guess this is what we deserve.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,120
But you... Why are you here at this very moment?

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,120
Rakshasi, I am not a part of your family. And I am aware I have no voice in this.

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,120
But Ping told me the destined one had arrived.

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Hmph. The destined one? Who doesn't even know what he's destined for?

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Those old bastards must have pulled a muscle coming up with the name.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
You and I both know who he truly is.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
When the time comes, your children, your husband, and even this very palace...

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
...could all turn to ashes.

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
What do I have to fear from a mere pawn?

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
He's no match for us.

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,560
You can't even rival the power of my fan.

27
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,260
Once the truth is revealed, suddenly he is here.

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,880
Do you not find it odd? Such a twist of fate.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,520
The truth? The truth of what? Who are you talking about?

30
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,500
I heard the Destined One had obtained all the other relics.

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,940
Rakshasi, your situation is grave.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Do you not see who mandated his return?

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,860
Were those relics really bestowed for your good?

34
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,520
Perhaps amid these schemes and plots,

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,380
we've unwittingly become stepping stones for his rebirth.

36
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,800
For others, I care not.

37
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,560
All along, you are all I care for.

38
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,200
I say we should leave together.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,080
I vow to treasure you dearly, just like when we were up there.

40
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,960
I never thought that one day you'd be the only one I can rely on.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,740
I am overwhelmed.

42
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,840
Come, sit with me, and tell me what to do.

43
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,740
Don't let him, Mother!

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,820
Don't you see? He is taking advantage of you!

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,280
You! You ledger!

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,700
Not for your help! Not your treachery!

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
How dare you!

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,300
A child of a concubine should know better manners.

49
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,440
When I first crossed paths with her,

50
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,340
your bull of a father was no more than livestock munching on a patch of grass.

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,940
Have you no shame? Mother, don't be fooled!

52
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,640
Enough of your endless prattle.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
No! No!

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,160
No! No!

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,400
No! No!

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,460
No! No!

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,580
No! No!

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:17,640
No! No!

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,720
No! No!

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:17,780
No! No!

61
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:17,920
No! No!

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,340
No!

63
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,100
No.

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,000
No.

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,000
That's better.

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,720
Rakshasi, have we not been this close since our time in Tishita Palace?

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,540
Well, yes.

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,180
I do miss the old days, too.

69
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,400
We were so happy back then.

70
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
What's in the blazes?

71
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,640
No jigs here.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,640
It's just my hood.

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:47,720
It's just my hood.

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Oof! You deserve to know before we kiss.

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,460
You will live to repent this!

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,340
Filthy lowlife!

77
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,020
You dare take her form and beguile me?

78
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,120
My old friend, wasn't it fun?

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,900
Have we not been this close since our carnage in the fox den?

80
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,780
You abhorrent fraud!

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
My candid words were wasted on your foul ears!

82
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,420
Candid, my hoof!

83
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,100
Your revenants are everywhere!

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,920
I thought you'd have better lies!
