00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Before the journey, Wukong lived free and easy.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,540
He wandered the lands and befriended the mighty.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,080
He had six sworn brothers, the Bull King among them.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,160
The Monkey and the Bull both called themselves Great Sages.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,920
They were two of a kind.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,560
As for their parting of ways and hard-fought strife, those are tales for another time.
