1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,760
My king, he treated me well.

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,500
To die for him, I would not regret it.

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,620
But I failed, brother.

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,540
Failing his mission is what I regret.

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,980
My king must have done something reckless for that darn boy.

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,220
The truth, I wager, lies beyond that door.

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,820
That raticast card was no match for me.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,440
I went easy on it, that's all.

9
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Quite a good lad you are.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,480
But remember, don't be off-sweat.

11
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,260
Stay true.
