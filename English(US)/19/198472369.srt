1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,640
You've atoned through deeds, Black Bear.

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,780
Take this pair of eyes.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
You've served the righteous cause, Yellow Rat.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,160
These ears are yours.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,540
Your power has gathered in you, Yellow Brow.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Keep this nose.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,960
You've endured hardships, Hundred-Eyed.

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,780
Go with the tongue.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
And the bull, it is the hardest to turn against a sworn brother.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,320
Now, you can have his body.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,260
Cheers.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Cheers.

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,760
Cheers.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:48,280
Wretched boy, your luck plagues your every step.

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,720
Never have you made a good choice.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Save your strength, brother!

17
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,320
We're yet to slay our way to the court and seize that senile emperor!

18
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,360
This one must be the chief of their troop.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Brother, watch my back.

20
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:29,980
Watch my back.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,000
Watch my back.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
While I go play with him!

23
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,580
Your reluctance is plain.

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
Just like my own.

25
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,280
They forced me.

26
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,260
To drink from the river of childbearing.

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,980
To bear that boy.

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,880
To bear that boy in my womb.

29
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,940
If not for that monkey,

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,960
we could have lived our separate lives in peace.

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,640
As if none of this had happened.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,960
You're all cute.

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,160
You knew who I was from the start.

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,820
Why do you choose to be their lapdog?

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,280
I never wanted to sever our ties.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
If kids are not my friends,

37
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,940
kinship means anything to you.

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,960
If antinomy demands you take the throne,

39
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,140
why should you ascend?

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,180
Yourただstariat englishman has ever been catched by the so-called king?

41
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,220
If Gymote could malign aria,

42
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,940
Shi'll be your common true slave.

43
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,400
Knowing you can fool me,

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,360
I'll damaged him even now.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,720
My king!

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm no longer your crown prince.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,800
Your whingeed be my most wholly intended.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
If you concept an evil pact,

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
only take that outcome.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,760
I am beating availability to vagram and homebrew.

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,400
Otherwise you won't live ducking as I say.

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
We're doomed.

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
We all will die,

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,660
no matter who we have to cut.

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:05,420
Your brother I've disciplined.

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,720
Your boy I've given away.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,400
Your wife's fan.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,240
Today, I'll take it with me too.

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Find a master and serve the right.

60
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,640
It's the only path left for the likes of us.

61
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,900
Don't you understand, brother?

62
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,460
Wukong, I took out the bull's concubine with a whack of my rake too.

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,400
Turned out, she was a fox, Gwai.

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,840
Counting all her Estándars, you'll never be your brother's sister again.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Did you find her?

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,360
I did, but with the power of observation.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,780
Et вижу al mahatte.

68
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,880
Tot tay по ambas la compagnie !

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,840
At elle sytyol bọ peghe dangges gehearted.

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,260
Andی nhoupe from?

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,260
Sank big son.

72
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,580
Govern is very old.

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,700
Y' בסtrojirdate.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,060
Wu kurio.

75
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,900
He giorno s 것ав Ged luz de hoci.

76
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:53,880
Thank you.

77
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:23,880
Thank you.

78
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,980
Staying alive is enough to be a transgression.

79
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,780
Brother, take care of your wife and children.

80
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,120
And remember, steer clear of my remains.

81
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:23,880
Thank you.
