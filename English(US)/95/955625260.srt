1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No more journey now.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,900
My king is suffering, yes.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,400
But does one not weave the threads of one's destiny?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,400
Peace is...

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,600
...living for yourself.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,600
His grace speaks true.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Indulge, and you shall be carefree.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,500
This joy...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,400
...it's new to me.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,900
Like...never before.
