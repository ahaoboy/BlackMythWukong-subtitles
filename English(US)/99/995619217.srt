Curse it! Bugs are bugs! Wearing human skin can't change your gross nature!

00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:35,020
Yeah, sure. We are so low compared to you, a glorious admiral of the court.

Ain't the last monkey still fresh in his grave? And here you are, another monkey's sidekick.

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,420

Truth is, the thing you seek is right here in the hollow. Flee now if you're too scared to come in.

00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,600

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,180
Truth! I'll destroy this rotten hole right now! Let's see where else you'd build your lair!
