00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Chubby one, we've done the rites. Where's the path?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
The path? Isn't it always there?

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,040
Don't you trick me, you bald, pot-bellied brat! All I'm seeing are mountains, no path at all!

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
He sees wisely with faith. You are daft without it.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,440
Cut your nonsense! You must be that trickster himself, fooling us all along! Take my rake!

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,440
Why so rude? I didn't force you to kneel! Throwing a tantrum at your age? Shame on you!

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,360
You brat! Save your stupid path! I'll borrow one myself!

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,480
You go on first. I'll meet you at the

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,560
scene. I'll be right back.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,640
You go on first. I'll meet you at the scene. I'll meet you at the scene.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
Oh, dammit!
