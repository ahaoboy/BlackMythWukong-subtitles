1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Behold! Be it the realm of sunset or the realm of gold, it's but an echo of the past.

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Legends speak of an ancient, colossal beetle in these sands.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Whilst deep in slumber, it lay hidden beneath the earth's embrace.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When awakened, it would devour all souls that crossed its path.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Its shell, harder than stone, defied the strikes of common arms.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It struck fear into travelling merchants and wider to neighbouring realms.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But a yellow-furred rat sensed the immense power emanating from the insect.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He halted the beetle's havoc and harnessed it for his own ends.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Overjoyed, the king named it.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He named the rat Gwaii, the royal sage, and built a shrine in his honour.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The bound beetle was a perfect source of power, so the rat stayed.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He seized the tongue monk using a new power and battled with soon Wukong upon the Yellow Wind Ridge.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Gwaii's formidable winds failed the vast expanse of the sky.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Were it not for Bodhisattva Lingji,

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
tongue monk's quest for the sun,

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the scriptures would have failed.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yet, stripped of the rat's protection,

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the kingdom was plunged into a state of ruin.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The once lush Yellow Wind Ridge now lies a desolate wasteland.
