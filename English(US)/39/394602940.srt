00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,580
Stop spare his life

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,140
Foul monkey no matter how many times you reincarnate you're still blind to the ways of this world

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,660
Now in your folly you've hindered the dealings of the court

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,100
But above that you've given a girl who knows no limits of false hope

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,400
I shall transform her into a mighty golden pill and

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,080
Keep it safe for you. Think about her. Won't you should you feel like stirring trouble in your next life?

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,140
You
