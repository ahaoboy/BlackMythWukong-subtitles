1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
We both bear misdeeds, things we had to do.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,140
Life demands of us acts we'd rather not.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,360
I've seen and severed the illusions of life.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,200
Now I devote my existence to the scriptures for redemption.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,300
It is as easy to recite as it is difficult to embody.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,380
Let not the years lead you to lament as they have led me.
