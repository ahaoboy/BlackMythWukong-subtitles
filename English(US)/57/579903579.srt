1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,620
you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,620
you

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,620
you

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,620
you

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,620
you

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,500
you

8
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,920
You tarried in the mortal world for a good while, didn't you?

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,880
Speak clearly.

10
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,000
Once again, I proved it to you, Jin Shansu.

11
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,060
You chose a means to an end, not to a proof.

12
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,500
You sow chaos in hearts just for the sake of winning.

13
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,760
How absurd and pathetic.

14
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,320
If not for winning, why debate over means and ends?
