1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,980
The Wind is His

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,060
The Wind is His

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,880
My brothers tested you at my behest

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,600
All for this day

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:37,320
And only now do I understand that fight

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,480
No prestige can shackle him

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,780
No band can keep him caged

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,440
A mortal death for an unbound mind and will

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,120
May you not fail him

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm now at peace

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,640
Your journey, though, has just begun
