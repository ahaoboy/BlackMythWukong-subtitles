1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
...

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Quite the charmer, aren't you, boy?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But these eyes have seen prettier

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
disguises.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
...

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Your true face! Out with it!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If a single

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
lie slips, my rake shall

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
strike, too!

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hmph. That was

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so close. Thank you for saving me.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am the Bull King's daughter, Ping-Ping.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nonsense!

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Bull has no daughter. Dare

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to fool me, scoundrel?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I... I

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
know who you are!

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My mother is Princess Fairfox.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You killed her!

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
...

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
...

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
...

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
...

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After my mother died,

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I've been living with my father.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
His wife, Princess Rickshasi,

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
took me in as her own.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Later, brother came back

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
from Bodhisattva Guanyin, and we

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
reunited. We had some

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
peaceful days.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My brother was kind to me

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and to our parents.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But somehow, not

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
long ago, he suddenly changed.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He secretly summoned his old

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
troops for a coup. Imprisoned father

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
kept mother under strict watch. I...

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I had nowhere else to

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
return. I had to go for help.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
...

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But barely after leaving the place, his

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
minions fell upon me.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Heh. The Bull King's might is known.

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Even together,

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wukong and I couldn't rival him.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Rickshasi's plantain fan

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is also formidable. And you

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
want me to believe that they were subdued

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
by a kid?

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
... Subdued by

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
their son?

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who else could make them put

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
their guard down? Really, we're soft-hearted

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and they could never harm him. You idiot!

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This fox is fooling you!

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look at this place!

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Only my brother's Samadhi fire

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
could wreak such havoc!

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh no! My father

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
is dying! Please, kind monkey,

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
help me and my family!

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A perilous place this is.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Keep this cicada

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
safe with you. It'll keep

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
coming handy.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
...

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's a

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
voice I know well.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll go ahead and take a look.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
...

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
...

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
...

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No time to lose

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
now!

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Follow me!

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
...

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
...

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This way!

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Keep up with me,

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
little ones!

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
...

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
...

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
...

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
...

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
...

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
...
