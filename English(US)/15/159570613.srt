1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,440
Big day! Big day! Big day! Big day! Big day! Big day! Big day! Big day!

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,140
Shut it.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,620
Stupid thing. Faster!

5
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,320
Hurry, hurry. They're here.

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,200
So excited about the wedding? Been dreaming about yours?

7
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,880
You little brat. Dare to tease me. Come here.

8
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,980
Stop it.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
I did. I take it back.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,780
Hey, look. The groom is here.

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,680
Apologies for keeping you waiting, sisters.

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,880
Wow. Is he really the one Mother's been expecting?

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,580
I thought he would look better.

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,800
He's not much to look at.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,860
But as long as Mother is happy.

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,020
Not much of a looker.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,780
But quite a fighter, though.

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,900
Had to use Mother's ancestral vessel to take him down.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,780
Still aching.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,180
And yet remote as we are...

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,820
We're going out and returning home.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
De conducting some illegal business,

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,500
but you ask girl what are we talking about?

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Because we aren't Vander evaluated at one point.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
No.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,460
We're going to believe that sex российский

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,600
and the proceeded step means reach the Organ Division.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,220
It's also out and about!

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,560
Uh-huh.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,640
What is it?

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,500
Apologies?

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,740
愛 looks great and I'm getting that sm���re Systems.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,920
Like Harrison and Paul?

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,060
Ah, I've had it.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,140
Who was on your own?

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,700
Arabic?

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,360
Even you like this farce.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,540
Go.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Go ahead and watch.

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,480
Sisters, the feast is yet to start.

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't tell me you're drunk already.

42
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,280
Right, he's nothing but Mother's meal.

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,760
No need to make a big fuss over him.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,180
Here, he is all yours.

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
You've done great.

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,160
Wait.

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,980
Mother has grown soft with age.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
And the girls are too young to know better.

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
But can't you see it's all wrong?

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,860
Yes, but try to think from her position.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,320
We're her children.

52
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,760
This is what we do.

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,360
But I am on her side.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,940
For decades, she's been tortured by her wound all thanks to this dumb thing.

55
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,460
And yet, she still wants to marry him.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,840
No!

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,200
I can't do this anymore.

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Love is not about forgiving or getting even.

59
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,220
It is never a fair game.

60
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,960
It's about two souls.

61
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,760
Woven together by fate.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,260
But I...

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,600
Neither of us was born then.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,380
We never witnessed her past.

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,600
That's why we can't understand her obsession today.

66
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,220
Have you told Uncle?

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Let's worry about that later.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Though her joy is borrowed, it's still joy before it's returned.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,400
You, come with me.

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,580
Follow me, everyone.

71
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,100
You know your mother.

72
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,340
I wait to see her.

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,760
You like her?

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,940
I have a bad feeling about this.

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,620
Consider this, Ihrio.

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,840
I can't tell our mother.

77
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,660
She's a monster.

78
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,580
Stop cursing oldен, pal.

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,700
I liked από party somente ago.

80
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,500
But I hate these days.

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,720
The same time, I prefer banishing.

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Go, there's no time to waste.

83
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,220
Batia, I have been waiting for so, so long.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Years up there haven't been kind to you.

86
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
But you're with me now.

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Girls, let the feast begin!

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,720
