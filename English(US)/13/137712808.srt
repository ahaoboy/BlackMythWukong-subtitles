1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,180
Master paid this child be born but he never knew my struggles

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How can we but follow the master's word

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,940
Raksha see you know it was he who made you drink from the river of childbearing

5
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,360
Shut it you shall never speak of it

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,960
The king knows why I had to drink it

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,340
But I haven't glimpsed him ever since then he made it another reason for his absence

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,940
Raksha see your husband shirks a dishonor this way

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,760
He granted you this cave with his mount bishwa beast as a sentinel. He's compromised enough for the sake of our master

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
You will seal your lips on this

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,400
Family would be doomed if anyone knew the truth behind this child

12
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,080
Fair not master bids me age you in secret

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
You and the bull

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
You will rear this child to manhood

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
When the boy comes of age

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,400
Well on that day

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,900
He will be living proof of the dark deeds of Mount Ling Shan

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
You
