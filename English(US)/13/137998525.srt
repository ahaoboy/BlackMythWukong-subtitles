1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
That stone monkey merely named himself a sage,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:11,220
yet this altar boy dared to found his own faith and proclaim himself Buddha.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,140
Your faith is firm and will unwavering.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,700
You resisted his lures.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,900
All those who were high and mighty found their minds lost and their faith stained.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,100
But was it truly because of their devotion to Yellowbrow?

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:38,220
As you braved ice and snow, did the stench of shattered ego reach your nose?
