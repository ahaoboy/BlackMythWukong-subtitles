1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,140
Fortune's gift it is!

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
It's Wukong's somersault cloud!

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,160
Ha ha ha ha!

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,920
I was wringing my brain out to fret you, but this savvy one's already on it!

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Ha ha ha!

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,000
It must have been hidden here amongst the mist until it sensed the relics on you.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,360
Thanks to them, it recalled its master and saved your skin.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,140
Now that it answers to your call, why not make good use of it?

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,140
Ha ha ha!

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,940
Your mortal body is too heavy for me in my wind form.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Ha ha ha ha!

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,560
All these henchmen of the court!

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,680
What draws them to this mountain?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,760
Let's find out!
