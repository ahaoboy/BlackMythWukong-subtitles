1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
I saw how this would end for you long ago.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,040
Keep fighting for others, and in time, you shall fall by their hands.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,260
I, Yellowbrow, fight solely for myself.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,180
I haven't lost.

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,440
I will not lose.

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:57,540
If only I could wield that monkey's rake just once more.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,240
I must fight.

8
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,400
Hmm.

9
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,540
This Rogue stole my Seedsack and fled here.

10
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,740
With Wu Kong's Relic he made it a soul-snatching vessel.

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,380
He also took my Look, and my Name, to trick his old friends.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,140
trick his old foes into vengeance.

13
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,840
You pot belly!

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,020
I should have figured out it was you.

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,400
Forgive my little deception.

16
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,800
Stolen once, I buy it.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,660
Stolen twice, I doubt it.

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,020
Your doubt is fair.

19
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,140
I shouldn't have underestimated his nerve.

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,880
I meant to subdue him myself,

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,180
but you two were swifter.

22
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,460
Fortune favors you, Bajie.

23
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,880
But I see great potential in this young one.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,460
He might just be...

25
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,540
the right monkey.

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,620
Enough of this empty talk!

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't care if Yellowbrow drowns in the lake.

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,600
We can't have Wukong's relic sink with him!

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,700
For that, pray lend me that rake of yours.

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,240
Bajie!

31
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,900
ê°€

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,360
is

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,820
this

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,920
and

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
and

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,000
we

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
are

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
not

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
together.

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,180
Hey!

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,800
You hurt 172!

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,100
He's evil!

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,000
you
