1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
Ah, you have grown in strength, but not in wisdom.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
You've not only hurt Bajia and his darling,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,180
but also laid waste to the seal of the High Ones.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,680
A grave misdeed.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,460
Mortal or immortal, all seek to break from the past and start anew.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,480
Yet destiny, like a lover's tongue, speaks one way and means another.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,980
Though you may savour it yourself, you can never tell if you truly want it or not.
