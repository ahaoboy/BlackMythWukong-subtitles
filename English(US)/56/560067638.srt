1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,800
All these years apart, and they've marred you like this.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:30,360
I journeyed from Mount Lee to delve into the mysteries of this valley.

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,120
I didn't mean to hold this back from you. It was because I had to.

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,300
I stayed my hand for my ties to his mother. That's why I called upon you.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:03,840
But how did you get this? I thought it was with the Hundred-Eyed Gwaii.

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,860
This may well be the design of destiny itself.

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,320
I shall help you and restore its power. Consider this as my token of gratitude.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I shall help you and restore its power. Consider this as my token of gratitude.

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I shall help you and restore its power. Consider this as my token of gratitude.

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,920
A few strings dangling from the sky. No one knows whether they lead to weal or woe.

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
Why does everyone vie to scale them?
