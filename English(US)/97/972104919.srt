1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
My friend, we've stuck a gold with this task, haven't we?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,500
Gold, my ass.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,260
My bones are cracking from lugging this load.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,540
Step it up.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,680
I gotta catch that feast on time.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,300
Hear me out.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,900
They say that hag has her quirky ways.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,660
Each season she'd wed a mate, then devour him.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,560
Once our lady brought her a wedding gift.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,340
A mirror.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,880
The past echo.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,940
Which?

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,200
The past echo.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
The lady often speaks of it with regrets.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,400
I wonder why.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Let me finish, will you?

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
The hag got the mirror and looked into it,

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,060
and for no reason at all, she threw it away.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,900
That soured our lady's mood.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
She stopped visiting since then.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,360
Gibbering and jabbering.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,540
Couldn't even catch her.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
She was in a wink of sleep this whole time.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,060
What? Who's in there?

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,680
How dare you spoil the gifts from Mount Wushan?

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Grrrr!

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Grrrr!

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Grrrr!

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Grrrr!

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Grrrr!

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Grrrr!

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Grrrr!

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Grrrr!

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Grrrr!

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Grrrr!

36
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Grrrr!

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Grrrr!

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Grrrr!

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Grrrr!

40
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Grrrr!

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
Grrrr!

42
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Grrrr!

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Grrrr!

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Grrrr!

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Grrrr!

46
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Grrrr!

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Grrrr!

48
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Grrrr!

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Grrrr!

50
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,200
Grrrr!

51
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,760
You really thought I of what happened these days.

52
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,380
Hey! Lovely!

53
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,380
Why don't you come down and join us?

54
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,540
Leaving so soon?

55
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,960
Why, the shyness?!
