1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,980
Today's clash didn't satisfy my spirit.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,600
Go back with me to the sky.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,300
Let us get drunk before we continue this fight.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
See what I am waiting for?!

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,340
You are already fÃ¥r incl!

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,840
Wait!

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,140
Where are you loses?!

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,740
ere?

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,080
Huh?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,420
Why would you do this...

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,080
Why is this Var0 around important...!

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,800
Guess what...

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,060
I got you all!

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,260
Yeah!

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,040
Look...

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,160
The best thing I can do is to have dinner.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,600
And...

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,800
you can trust me.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:00:59,820
I am willing.

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:00:59,860
One recommendation from me.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:00:59,960
Pour and you can have the food.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Starbucks.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:24,480
None has what it takes to push me into this, but...

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
This monkey!

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,480
I've been thinking of you every day since...

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Monkey...

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,720
Such power must be new to you.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,720
You should first spar with them a while.
