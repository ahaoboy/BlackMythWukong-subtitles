1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
I remember what the Buddha said at the Ulumbana.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,040
All beings suffer as they heed not the precepts and indulge.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,820
I say, nonsense!

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,160
Thou shalt kill, lest feuds instill.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,460
Thou shalt snatch a fair play in a fair match.

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,300
Thou shalt lust before all loves turn into dust.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,520
Thou shalt boast for prestige and legacy it doth host.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,820
Thou shalt drink and drenched unease shalt sink.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,740
Thou shalt revel, prime year shalt be spent to settle.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,540
Thou shalt dream to reach in bleak void the sole gleam.

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,280
Thou shalt indulge, or life is but a scourge.
