1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
By what decree must his head be hung for all to see?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,140
By what decree must the waters he governed roam free?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,980
By what decree must all matters not know how to be?

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,440
By what decree must mercy's hands so woe upon thee?

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,700
By what decree must from streams into sands thou flee?

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
Resonant waves profound, pulsing through the ground,

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,260
evade their might unbound, and victory is surely found.
