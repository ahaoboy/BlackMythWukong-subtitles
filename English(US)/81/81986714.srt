00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,160
mortal woe and grief. He deemed all souls could be akin to us.

2
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,740
Why then do we tower whilst others merely kneel and offer? He asked.

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:55,380
I told him the others are less than us. His misstep cast him back into the endless cycle.

5
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:14,340
others fugitives. He too took to the shadows. Pathetic. Those journeyers have misplaced their worship.

6
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,160

He was a man of the past, but he was a man of the future.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,880
He was a man of the past, but he was a man of the future.

9
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,580
Kneel before the Buddha of the future.
