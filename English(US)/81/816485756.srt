00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hrm!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hrm!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hrm!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hrm!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hrm!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hrm!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hrm!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hrm!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hrm!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hrm!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hrm!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hrm!

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hrm!

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hrm!

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hrm!

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hrm!

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hrm!

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hrm!

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hrm!

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hrm!

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hrm!

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hrm!

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hrm!

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hrm!

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hrm!

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hrm!

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hrm!

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You must have heard tales about him.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hrm!

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Some say he helped Tongue Monk

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to preach the scriptures,

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
was granted Buddhahood,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and stayed on Mount Lingshan thereafter.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hrm!

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hrm!

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hrm!

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hrm!

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Some say

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it was not him who was granted Buddhahood.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hrm!

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hrm!

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The real him

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
was already dead

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
on the journey to the West.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hrm!

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hrm!

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Some say

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that the journey never happened.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hrm!

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He is nothing but a monkey

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
who lives in some storyteller's tall tale.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hrm!

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hrm!

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But now,

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you will hear a tale

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which no one has ever known.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hrm!

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hrm!

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When Tongue Monk

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:57,820
played the touched

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:27,980
