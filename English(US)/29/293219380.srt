1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hold your monkeys.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let me fix you up a little.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome, good sirs. The feast is all set. Please come in and be our guests.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:21,000
My, gentlemen. You're fashionably late.

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Is your lady not joining us again this time?

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Our lady prefers not to be late.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our lady prefers not to be late.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Our lady prefers not to be late.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But she's been thinking of you all and sent this small token.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She hopes your lady will recover soon and pay her visit up there.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a pity she didn't come.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or she would certainly enjoy a splendid show we've prepared for her.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But now...

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But now...

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The gift's gone and blood's been shed.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I say you two should take the fall.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're just servants, madam.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's the jest?

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Zhu Ba Jie.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know you find your look embarrassing.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But why hide from my mother with another pig face?

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You rag Islamic Sh depending on a boner.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The time is now an best-å¾… thing.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We all know this little town is some ghoul shop.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This ten-year-old boy's usual poker face isn't important anymore, what devils!

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Shut up, now!

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mistress Double's a single clueless woman, and Mr. 14th's like a fox in a sit-downey.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thought this was an ending to the fish-free house?

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Deserted, allied.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Blasphemous.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tired.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Polite.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Reputation?

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,760
Yaoguai's care about reputation. All she cared about was lust.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Now I know. You're one of her spiderlings, aren't you?

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Well, well. Your rudeness is forgiven. Show some respect. Maybe I'll kindly pay

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,240
your mother a visit.

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Visit or not, I'm afraid that is not your call.
