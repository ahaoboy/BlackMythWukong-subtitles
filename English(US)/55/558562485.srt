00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
With the wind and sand you've endured here, did you reach the forgotten kingdom at the end of the land?

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,840

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:24,540
If you shut your ears and heed only your inner murmur, I fear the more you yearn for flawless endings, the further you'll stray from the path.

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:32,240

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,600
Listen closely, young one, their complaints ride upon the wind.
