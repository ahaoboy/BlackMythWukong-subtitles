00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,320
It's been a while, but the Immobilize spell still works like a charm.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,620
Since you hail from Mount Huagu, it won't hurt to teach you a handy trick.

3
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,340
Now, here we go. Give me your hand.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,920
There you go. Should you come across any miscreants, just point your finger at them and release this spell.

5
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,240
You'll be able to hold them in place while giving yourself a breather.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Sadly, mine is but a humble trick.

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Its power will wear off within a few short moments.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Though it's good enough against boneheads like this one.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Anyway, just consider it an ace up your sleeve.

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No! The Yaoguas these days know no manners!

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Fear not. Teach them a lesson with your new spell!
