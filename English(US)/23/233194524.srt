1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,840
My master...safe.

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,040
The scriptures...sound.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:34,200
All I ever wanted was a life in my mountain, free from you and your so-called merits.

4
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,840
Those high above don't trust me. I understand that.

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,160
And they send you and those knuckleheads to threaten me.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,340
To obey and serve once more.

7
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,020
I understand that too.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
But what I don't understand is...

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,000
You bastards killing my kind!

10
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:31,660
Stay back, stupid dog.

11
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,460
Stay back, stupid dog.

12
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,480
Stay back,uurgh

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Stay back,supid dog!

14
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,360
Savor it.

15
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,140
Savor it.

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,720
no

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,420
Feck this screen!

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,920
Savorti.

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,420
Savorty, they won't respond any more!

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,920
Savor them on the grid!

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,420
Mark this!

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,920
Mark This!

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,380
Mark It!

24
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,900
Mark It!

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,340
Mark This.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,340
He's not just any monkey.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
He's a monkey of merit.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
A monkey was made Buddha once.

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,840
None other than me can challenge him to a duel.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Look, monkey.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,340
I don't make a habit of fighting someone I've bested before.

32
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,840
Here's my offer.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,340
If you lose, I'll take you to the Celestial Court.

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,840
They will stay and level your mountain.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,340
But if I lose, I shall certainly take revenge.

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,340
And they will level your mountain nonetheless.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,340
How tragic would that be, huh?

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
You are one of the court.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,340
We don't need to resort to violence.

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:58,840
How about you bend the knees, admit the wrongs, and we can put this behind us?

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,840
All these years...

42
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,840
Except for that pig.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
You're the one who talks the tallest tales.

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Good. I am entertained.

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Speaking of entertainment...

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,340
Wouldn't it be fun if I pluck your extra eye out for my snack

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,840
and allow you to keep the other two?

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,340
Because I'd hate to let you miss how I'll slaughter each mongrel of the court.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,840
Those below, those above, and that black mutt of yours.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Come at me.

51
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
All of you!
