1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,400
What does it matter if you become a Buddha that headband has always been on your head

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Keep those eyes wide open

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Watch me rip it off and break free

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sooo

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,520
When you defied the celestial court

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,640
I had to seal you beneath the mountains with my immense power

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,160
Yet after enduring punishment you embrace the dumb

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,060
uplifted good against evil and subdued

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,920
Yaukai's throughout the journey

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,900
For your contribution. I now bestow upon you the title of victorious

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,900
victorious fighting Buddha

13
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,360
He defied the celestial court and the Jade Emperor imposed three ordeals

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,260
Only when the chicken finishes pecking the rice the dog laps up the flowers and the lamp burns through the key the rain will fall

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,900
My weeping Knight

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
In a flashed arrogance

17
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,260
And

18
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
You

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
You

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,520
you

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,520
you

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,520
you

23
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,400
you

24
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,840
bottoms up brothers one final toast before we crash the celestial palace

25
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,520
you
