1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Our sire's head was hung when he defied the Celestial Court.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,600
We dreaded the Jade Emperor's wrath and pleaded with Master Yuan to help us abscond from our

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:28,080
waters, but he warned us we might hide for a time, but not forever.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In the end, someone will come to claim our lives.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,640
He had more to say.

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,100
Sires to sons, we are destined to die for the righteous cause.

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,640
I trust him, yet I won't obey.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,560
May your path not once more be a mere thread in their grand design.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,780
The

10
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,780
Earth is yours.

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,460
All three of your brothers have been claimed.

12
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,000
If not now, when will you reunite?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ah.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,360
History repeats itself, always.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,780
Why not cast the die once more?
