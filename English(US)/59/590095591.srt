1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, thank me to Ba.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Finally then the three bells sang.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Disciples come, I hear travelers approaching my temple carrying new treasures.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I cannot see you, but I recognize your odor.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It cannot be you. You are back.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It must be you who took that Kasaya.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now give it back.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Give it back.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Give it back.
