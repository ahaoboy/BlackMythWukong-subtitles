1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
You're here.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,360
We're here.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,540
Step aboard.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,460
Hey, old monkey.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,860
I hope this isn't a one-way trip, is it?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
Isn't all life a one-way trip?

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,120
Once you embark on the journey, there's no turning back.

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,440
What is this place?

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,640
His memories.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
His memories.

11
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,500
Since his early days, he'd had an eye for the finer things, and a will to wrest them from others.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,900
Laying his eyes on, then craving to see.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,260
His memories.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,380
Their riches.

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,440
No better than the Black Bear and Jincha, I say.

16
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,840
He can't have an eye for the finer things, while the Buddha oversees the three realms?

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,040
Well, I hardly think that's fair.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,980
How insatiable.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,280
Not content with his kingdom and title below, he asked for a position in the Celestial Court.

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,380
But soon after his wish was granted,

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
his joy turned to rage.

22
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,380
All because he wasn't invited to a feast.

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,380
He nearly ruined the entire Celestial Palace.

24
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Ah, years fume at unfavorable news.

25
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,380
As untamed and ungrateful as that yellow rat.

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,380
Beasts are beasts, don't you think?

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,380
He was young. He didn't know any better.

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Hadn't learned from the Buddha or our master yet.

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,940
But he was young. He didn't know any better. Hadn't learned from the Buddha or our master yet.

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
But he was young. He didn't know any better.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
But he was young. He didn't know any better.

32
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
But he was young. He didn't know any better.

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Aren't you being a bit harsh? Dredging up the scandals from his youth?

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Aren't you being a bit harsh? Dredging up the scandals from his youth?

35
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,940
Like his adulthood was any better.

36
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Since his release, he had claimed to have learned manners and discipline.

37
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,940
Yet his wee frankincense gave him away.

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,940
Posing as an idol, he degraded the gods.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Clear was his defiance of the doctrines he had learned.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
Well, he was so much more than that.

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,940
He was just being naughty.

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Aren't all great achievers somewhat self-obsessed?

43
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,940
Myself included.

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Nose in the air, feeling above others.

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,940
I say, he was no less insolent than that yellow-browed brat.

46
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Wait, isn't it that... the lady of some sort?

47
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
Hmm.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Hmm.

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,940
It was her tricks that made Master drive Wukong away.

50
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,940
On White Tiger Ridge, he forsook his love.

51
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Three times he broke her into pieces, convincing himself his heart would ache no more.

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,940
Yet, as you must know, he had never let go of her.

53
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Otherwise,

54
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,940
he wouldn't have been so eager to get away from the Buddha-hood he attained.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,940
Those who talk much of love will one day bite their tongues.

56
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,940
On this matter, he was akin to you and your many darlings.

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,940
No matter where you are, you'd always fall captive to the web of mortal desire.

58
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Why bring me into this?

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,940
True, I don't have the wits to break the web, but...

60
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,940
He had torn his way out since that day.

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
Gah.

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,940
Take a look, Bajie. Can you see?

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Many of your good friends are here.

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,940
We're just fair-weather friends, that's all.

65
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,940
But they are still friends, aren't they?

66
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
So you say, so it must be.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
These old buddies...

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,940
I think none of them ended up well.

69
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Indeed.

70
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,940
For ages, countless gifted souls have walked this earth.

71
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Yet of them, how few have forged everlasting greatness.

72
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Do you know why?

73
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Injustice?

74
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,940
Never has it been just.

75
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Misfortune?

76
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Fortune is simply...

77
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Humility in the mighty.

78
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Well, mayhaps.

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,940
They simply lacked my charm.

80
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,940
Gifted they may be, yet strive they not.

81
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Content with little, and lost in lust.

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Seek the ease, yet crave the renown.

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,940
They yearn for freedom, yet aspire to Buddhahood.

84
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
They always want both.

85
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Yet nobody can, and nobody should.

86
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Such was the folly of the Bull King and Wukong.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

89
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Destiny's favor calls for the resolution to sever all desires.

90
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,940
You should mark well these words.

91
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

92
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

93
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

94
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

95
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

96
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,940
Hold on.

97
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
This can't be Wukong's memory.

98
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,940
You're fooling us, aren't you?

99
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Ah.

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Five of the six relics call for one.

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Bajie, tell me which.

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

103
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Mind!

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
It's mind.

105
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,940
What did you just see?

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
The three of us?

107
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
That was the last one.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Oh, I see now.

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,300
It was you.

110
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I knew it from the beginning.

111
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,180
You were the mind of Wukong all along.

112
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,180
That's why you led us here.

113
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,940
Not me.

114
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
It's him.

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
Don't make me laugh.

116
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,620
Him?

117
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,060
He is Wukong?

118
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,660
Yes...

119
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
and no.

120
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,060
Cuts to the chase, will you?

121
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,300
We didn't come this far for your riddles.

122
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,300
After Wukong died,

123
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,100
five of his six senses endured

124
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,660
and were taken by the Yaoguai kings.

125
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,900
Only his mind was lost.

126
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,740
Mind is the first of the six.

127
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,180
It's the essence unique to every life.

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,460
Therefore,

129
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,980
its destiny

130
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,100
is to fade away at life's end.

131
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,260
Hold on.

132
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
You mean Wukong's gone for good?

133
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Never to return?

134
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
You old bastard!

135
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
You've been lying to us all this time!

136
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,260
That Wukong you knew will never return.

137
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,780
But what made him remains.

138
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,540
The universe will always bear him a successor.

139
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,860
One who shall carry on his name and nature.

140
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,780
This chosen successor is the destined one.

141
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,580
Nameless you were.

142
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,060
Yet perils and mighty foes you've braved to recover his relics.

143
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:40,060
Your will now stands resolute, worthy of his power.

144
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,820
You mean this is the end of the world?

145
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,380
You mean this boy is to take Wukong's name?

146
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,660
He's not!

147
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,260
Soon Wukong is long gone!

148
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:58,700
Bajie, Deep Town, you know he wasn't all that perfect.

149
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:10,060
Now that he is dead, this one, perhaps, shall bear the name in his stead.

150
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,100
Bajie, Deep Town, you know he wasn't all that perfect.

151
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,100
Now that he is dead, this one, perhaps, shall bear the name in his stead.

152
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,500
Now that he is dead, this one, perhaps, shall bear the name in his stead.
