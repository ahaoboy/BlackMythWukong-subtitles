1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
You disciple, you're a fool.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,800
You stole Erlang's spell and snatched the Great Sage's relic.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,700
You even took your master's head.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,000
Just for a short reign over this barren valley.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,660
Amitabha.

6
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,980
I am Bodhisattva Lama.

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,800
The Warring-chi of New Mount Sumeru.

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,360
The Warden of this Rat.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
After the Great Sage's passing, his six senses were scattered across the mortal realm.

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
This thieving rat chanced upon one of them.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,980
Yet hindered by his meager might, he could not absorb its power.

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,160
Thus he schemed with wicked intent.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,540
A victim of his deceit.

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,960
I had my head taken by him.

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,140
The sense requires such a grand container to release its power.

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,080
I should bear the blame for his reign of havoc upon this ridge again.

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:53,040
Through your valor and sagacity, order has been restored.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,340
You are the sole worthy one to keep it.

19
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,140
Please, keep it secure in my stead.
