1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I missed and dreamed way too long ago.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,140
Why dredge up the past? Aren't we here now?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,900
Don't you remember how I spared your life when he asked me to clean up the rest of your sisters?

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,040
I do remember.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:33,960
And more than that, I even remember how I survived on my sister's flesh after you left.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,040
That's not all on us. The culprit is that centipede.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,460
All would have lived if he didn't weigh my master's flesh over your lives.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,960
Yes, he was blinded by greed.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,580
But he has repented and made his compensation.

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,580
He...

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,360
He even offered that thing to sustain my life.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,500
Otherwise, I'd never live to see you today.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,200
My dear, is that true? That thing is in your hands.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Unbelievable. Even now, in your heart, the monkey still comes first.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,600
The monkey? Nah, for me, beauty always comes first.

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,100
Good.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,020
Good.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,020
I'll carry on with these nice words.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,940
Once I'm satisfied, I might lift my finger and tell you where to find it.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,620
You wicked hag! Can't you see your old face?

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,300
Still obsessed with all this lovey-dovey crap at this age? Ridiculous!

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,380
Yes!

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,880
Every day trapped in this hollow, I missed and dreamed, waiting for the day.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,780
To get you right after we mate.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,780
So I can heal.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,060
Then eat! Could have saved me from your stupid ceremony and vows!

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,360
What a farce!

28
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,540
My appetite is lost.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,540
Not just for you.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
But also for her.

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
No!

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,400
Mother?

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Mother?

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,440
Hideous! Hideous spider! Who fathered such a thing?

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,520
Your fate today has nothing to do with me!

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,980
I had my mercy misplaced, that's all!

37
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,620
What took you so long? I almost died!

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,540
Now go call your sisters and get me down!

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,620
Monkeys, the bane of my life.

40
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,960
Why do you always have to ruin my plans?

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,360
In what way am I any less than monkeys?

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,740
This monkey that you love.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,340
I'll chop his heart.

44
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,440
Slice his liver.

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,840
And make you eat them!
