1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
Across streams, over hills, and through the black wind your blood has spilled.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,180
Wolves howl, snakes wind, flames lick, and the smoke blinds.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,800
Stumble on the lesser, lame.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,860
Crash before their betters, shame.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,400
With such clumsiness, what destiny do you claim?

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,560
As the small fish catches its prey, the bigger lurks behind.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
And who is the bigger fish?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,260
I can't see it.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,760
As for the prey and the small fish, they are swimming everywhere.
