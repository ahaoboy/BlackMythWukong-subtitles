1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Son, I hear you loud and clear.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,580
How can I not know your sufferings?

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,600
But before our master returns from the valley,

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,700
we've got to tough it out.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,560
Tough it out to survive.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,140
The lads went out to see the altar the other day.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Said it's stinking worse than ever.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,260
And covered in bones.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,040
Not from men or livestock,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,420
but lizard in the remains of our kin.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,800
Curse that furry jackass.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,820
Just wait.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Wait until master hears about this.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,760
Hush.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
Hush, you fool.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,300
Our restoration.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,080
We can't say it.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,140
We can't say it out loud now.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,140
Your poor brother hadn't...

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
What's that smell?

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Oi, that's fresh meat.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Delivering itself all the way to this dump for our lunch.
