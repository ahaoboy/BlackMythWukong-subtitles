1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
My friend, Yellow Wind Ridge, offered me nothing.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,840
Yellow Brow, the Buddha, was my next plea.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,380
Only after meeting his grace in the new West did I see.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,520
I wasted my life for others, and missed much joy.
