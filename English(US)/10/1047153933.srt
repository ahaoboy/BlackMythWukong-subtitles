1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
Yakshas are the mightiest of the eight legions, after all.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,340
Be your body hard as metal, meeting death in scores is inevitable.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,700
Yet why did you endure the fish and those carts just as poorly?

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,900
You rush like wind with a clouded mind.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,520
It's your desires that shape what you see.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,620
Had your mind been less unsettled, would you still have fallen for that child's play?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,700
Haste oft blinds while patience illumines.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,840
Next time, can you still fulfill as Wukong without Bajie?
