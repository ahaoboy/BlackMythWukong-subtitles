1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
On the go, bend the toe, life of human or for gold?

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,800
Oh, nowhere better than a home.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,100
Weed she doth and ever grow.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,000
Huh?

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,080
Yeah, you see.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,040
What bliss, my faint souls.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,200
Well, well, luck's around the corner.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,180
Seems like he just fell from a fruit tree here.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,620
Perfect timing.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
This peach knew I needed a snack.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,180
You sneaky rascal.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,760
Dad fool me?

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll make sure you regret it.
