1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Hail'd bird, hail'd bird, what dimm'd your shine?

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:25,720
Past's grip beyond our grasp, the future we may still clasp.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,360
Late is the hour, young one, in which you choose to stay in my tranquil abode.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,920
Pray tell, to what end do you seek?
