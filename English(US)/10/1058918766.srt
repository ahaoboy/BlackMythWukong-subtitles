1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,920
I have rebuilt the temple.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,500
Now it's grander in scope.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:34,300
All those monks consumed by the fire turned to wandering ghosts roaming in Blackwind Mountain.

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,900
It was I who granted them eternal repose.

5
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:51,260
I have even restored the charred scriptures piece by piece.

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,460
But oh, no.

7
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:51,480
I have restored the charred scriptures piece by piece.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,300
Oh, yes, I always knew.

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,580
One day you shall return.
