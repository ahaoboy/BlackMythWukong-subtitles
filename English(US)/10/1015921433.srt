1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Foolhardy. Nothing more. I've done as our brother asked. Till we meet again!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, I'm not sorry.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's okay.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Your faith has led you here.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Rest easy.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You won't find those noisy chanting.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and pained screamings here.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A nice ripe melon.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Want a bite?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mmm.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's better than you think.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sun Wukong used it to trick that disciple of mine.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Come.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come closer.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now you've found this place, I'll teach you a trick neither of them knows.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your hand.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Spellbinder. It hurts no foe but binds yourself.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You'll come to understand its use.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
An old friend of Sun Wukong came to me, wanting some peace.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I led him to the Great Pagoda. Have you paid him a visit?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They say you are the destined one.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But if destiny is set, what difference do our actions make?

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the greatest adventure of all.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sun Wukong and Sun Wukong.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Fade away.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Just like the sun.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then, the sun will not shine.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The sun will not shine.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sun Wukong.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sun Wukong.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sun Wukong.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sun Wukong.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sun Wukong.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sun Wukong.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sun Wukong.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sun Wukong.
