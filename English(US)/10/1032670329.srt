1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,680
A ghost, weren't you dead already?

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,160
For years I prayed you'd find peace.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,400
Still you come to take my life in penance against yours.

4
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,860
You wouldn't understand my agony when I took your life.

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,660
The Buddha sees no such thing.

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,580
Vengeance.

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,200
I shall usher you to the beyond once more.
