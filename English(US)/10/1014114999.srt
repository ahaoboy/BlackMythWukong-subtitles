1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Father, I've brought him here. It's the destined one. Brother is not around. You can hand it over to him now.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,580
Brother will surely give up on his plan once it's returned. And then we will be a family again.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:24,520
You mischievous monkey. You dare to push your luck, but always have a way out.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:32,840
Only you came back at the wrong time.

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,580
Are you not thinking straight, Father? I brought the destined one here to save you.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:52,580
I may be unwell, but I am not blind. You are not my daughter.

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:05,200
How can you say that to me? I went through flames to find the destined one for you. For you, Father, don't you see?

8
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,020
I should have locked my eyes out too.

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,200
To save you.

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,220
To save me from your pretense.

11
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,520
Worry not, old horned fool. I'll see to it shortly.

12
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,220
You could have enjoyed a good show.

13
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,420
But you simply lost.

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,500
You simply lost.

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,520
You simply lost.

16
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,140
You lack the taste. I should have just killed you all.

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,220
My guise was perfect. None could see a single flaw in it. How did you find out then?

18
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:19,480
Unlike you, she has never needed to fake her respect for me.

19
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:28,940
Interesting.

20
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,280
Interesting.

21
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,160
It's that little fox.

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,640
I will find out if it's true after I hunt her down.

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,380
But first, I should burn you two together and mix your ashes to honor your friendship.

24
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,460
Entertainment.

25
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,220
That can wait.

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Entertainment.
