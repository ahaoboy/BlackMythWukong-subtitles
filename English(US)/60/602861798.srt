00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
Oi kid, you look suspicious. What kind of yaoguai are you?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,720
I'm looking at that Buddha over there

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,520
See his belly button. It's so big

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,160
Me and you we look way smaller. Buddha?

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,240
Where is it?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,020
You see no Buddha because you think no Buddha

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,980
No thought no sight

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,180
I, the sacred Gourmand, saw enough Buddhas before you were born

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,180
Foolish brat

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,520
You didn't see that coming did you?

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,680
True hearts find their path and the Buddha is on that path

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Why not worship with a true heart? The path might just show itself

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,420
Worship my hoof! Visit temples, kneel to figures, you tell no black from white. That's my master.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,940
I am fed up with all these skin-deep rites

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,380
No true heart, the path is sealed

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,320
With true heart it's revealed
