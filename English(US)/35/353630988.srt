1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hmm.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Have you seen those nameless souls adrift on your path?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,600
Their wills float aloft, never to fade.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Shame, your gourd serves little purpose, and mine answers solely to me.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
Hmm.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I know a way to guide the souls, mend their paths and set them free.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
It will aid you.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Ah.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Now, this is better. This gourd.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Though humble, may save the lost, banish their obsessions and guide them.
