1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,620
You cunning wretch! I'll spare your sorry life for today!

2
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,840
Fortune is no longer on your side!

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:29,820
No one will come to your aid. All I need is to take it elsewhere and rebuild everything anew!

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Great... sage!

6
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh, pardon me, young sage! Mercy!

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,660
I was just a pawn of the Celestial Court!

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:10,040
If given a choice, who dared to challenge the mighty wrecker of the Celestial Palace?

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:20,660
His words ring true. No matter how daring he was, he had not the nerve to harm the great sage.

10
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,580
There must be someone else pulling all the strings.

11
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,580
Exactly!

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm sorry, young sage. I'm sorry!

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm sorry!

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,040
Exactly! And this thing is eerie! I had no idea how to make use of its power...

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,280
...except to enshrine it up there, tricking lesser yaoguays into offerings!

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,580
If you pardon me, I'll go back to Guan Yin to atone for my actions and be put back on the engaging band!

17
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,820
You will never see me out there anymore!

18
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:07,360
Oh, ignore his nonsense! Go now, little monkey! Go and retrieve the great sage's relic!

19
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,700
MRS JUNG!

20
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,580
I can't hear you!

21
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,480
What?

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:32,880
Mwee!

23
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,120
You have not heard myæ‡‚ings?

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,500
Tell me about your memory.

25
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,440
How did Mwee old man come to know you?

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,240
Of course I heard him.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't take that from me!

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
How could you, young sage?

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,080
Strange, young sage, think so?

30
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,520
Maybehe has known each other for many years, but after what happened, he hid a little secret in his heart.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,940
He was just like a clam to disown his muzzle everyone.

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,060
Is that right?

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,020
You did not like him?

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,120
No.
