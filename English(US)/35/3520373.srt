1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For all his foresight, Yuan the Sign Teller could never have known that.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've hidden upon his garb as a pattern.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Our sire gave his life to pave the way for the journey.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And not a day passes that we do not yearn to avenge him.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yet every day we find ourselves adrift without a home to call our own.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll kill you.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To unbind us.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To build our destinies.
