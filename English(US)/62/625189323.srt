00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Here, at the western end of the world, each day the sun sets and boils the sea.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,640
The boiling hiss is sharp enough to ravage babies in their cradles.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,360
The people sound drums to counter the impact, but the drums draw this yaoguai.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,720
The vessel this yaoguai holds protects it from me.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,020
Your boldness in venturing here is clear.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,120
Aid me with this.
