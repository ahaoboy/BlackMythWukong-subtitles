1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Entangled in the web of all deceptions of the heart,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,040
who knows which thread in the net of my thoughts marks me true?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,440
In a place for chanting and peace, you weak of blood,

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,020
sit and seek solace in the scriptures with me.
