00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,440
How delightful it still recalls your scent

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,620
When that monkey was alive he was all about a weeping and begging for help

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,020
Now even in death he led all you younglings right to me

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
This sack of mine can barely fit you all

7
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,160
Kang Jing long now that you are ready go and weigh up this one for your master

8
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,620
See if this monkey merits a place amongst my disciples

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You
