1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
This place is a jumble of rats and cats, all at each other's throats.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,400
And the yellow wind sage keeps silent.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
How odd.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,880
Who would swear fealty to such a king?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,280
Best make haste and go.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,960
Never linger in a peril such as this.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,760
Just leave.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
These rats are no match for me.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,360
I can make my own way out.
